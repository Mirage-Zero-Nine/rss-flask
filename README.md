# rss-flask

## What is this?

This is a web service that can generate RSS XML for user to subscribe.

It's only a small demo for now, no database is involved at this point (which should be). Only one router (Twitter) completed. More routers may be added later.

## What's the purpose?

For now, the reason I built this is to have a stable Twitter RSS subscription service to monitor certain public service account (like local police department).

## Deployment

- Create a directory: `mkdir YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME`.
- Move to the directory and clone this repo: `cd YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME && git clone https://github.com/Mirage-Zero-Nine/rss-flask.git`.
- Create a `authentication.yaml` (required only if you want to generate Twitter user feed) to store your Twitter BEARER_TOKEN:
  Sample:
  ```yaml
  token:
    twitter_token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
  ```
- Build docker image: `docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .`
- Start container: `docker run -d --restart=always --name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME -p 5000:5000 YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest`.
- Now you can access the RSS file via `localhost:5000/PATH_TO_ROUTER` to access RSS router.


## Dependency

See `requirement.txt`. It is generated by `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

## Known Issue
- No demo provided for this service. You will need to deploy the service on your own computer, or a cloud host (e.g.: Amazon EC2).
- RSS feed time may not be incorrect since I'm still trying to figure out how to correctly set timezone info in `datetime` object. The cloud host I used to deploy this service use UTC and you may need to align with that to avoid timezone issue.
