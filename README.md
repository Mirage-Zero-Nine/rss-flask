## What is this?

This is a web service that can generate RSS XML for user to subscribe.

It's only a small demo for now, no database is involved at this point (which should be). Only one router (Twitter) completed. More routers may be added later.

## What's the purpose?

For now, the reason I built this is to have a stable Twitter RSS subscription service to monitor certain public service account (like local police department).
