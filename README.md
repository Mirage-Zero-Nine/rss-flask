# rss-flask

## What is this?

This is a simple web service written in Python to generate RSS feed for websites. Currently only few websites are supported (see `app.py` for details). I'm trying to add more routers to the service. 

No demo provided for this service. You will need to deploy the service on your own computer, or a cloud host (e.g.: Amazon EC2).

## Deployment

- Create a directory: `mkdir YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME`.
- Move to the directory and clone this repo: `cd YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME && git clone https://github.com/Mirage-Zero-Nine/rss-flask.git`.
- Build docker image: `docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .`
- Start container: `docker run -d --restart=always --name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME -p 5000:5000 YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest`.
- Now you can access the RSS file via `localhost:5000/PATH_TO_ROUTER` to access RSS router.

## Dependency

See `requirement.txt`. It is generated by `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

## Routers

See `app.py` for router path.

### Parameters for router
- `/currency/<currency_name>`: only support CNY to USD, `currency_name` is a placeholder for future usage.
- `/zaobao/realtime/<region>`: two regions supported for now: `world` and `china`.


## Scheduler

You can add a router in `utils/scheduler.py`. This can make the specific router to automatically refresh content, and the time period is controlled by `refresh_period_in_minutes`.
