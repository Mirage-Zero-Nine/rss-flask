# rss-flask

## What is this?

This is a web service that can generate RSS XML for user to subscribe.

It's only a small demo for now, no database is involved at this point (which should be). Only one router (Twitter) completed. More routers may be added later.

## What's the purpose?

For now, the reason I built this is to have a stable Twitter RSS subscription service to monitor certain public service account (like local police department).

## Dependency

See `requirement.txt`. It is generated by `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

## Deployment

- Create a directory: `mkdir YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME`.
- Move to the directory and clone this repo: `cd YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME && git clone https://github.com/Mirage-Zero-Nine/rss-flask.git`.
- Create a `authentication.yaml` to store your Twitter BEARER_TOKEN:

Sample:
```yaml
token:
  twitter_token: YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```
- Build docker image: `docker build -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME .`
- Start container: `docker run -d --restart=always --name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME -p 5000:5000 YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest`.
- Now you can access the RSS file via `localhost:5000/PATH_TO_ROUTER` to access RSS router.
